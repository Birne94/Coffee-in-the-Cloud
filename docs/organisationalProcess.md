# Organisational Process

## General

Likewise many other software projects, we used for coffe-in-the-cloud the scrum technique. That means we organised the project with Jira, which is an issue tracking software developed by Altassian. Our main communication tool for the team itself was Slack and Facebook messanger. We used Slack as it provides the possibility to integrate git notifications and many more. We had weekly standup meetings and biweekly sprints.
