#Introduction

Making coffee is a part of most people’s daily life. Some need it to get going in the morning, others meet in the afternoon and enjoy it in company.

People use it on any occasion as a reason to take a break. Just like there are different occasions to drink it, there are different methods to acquire it; the coffee shop next door, a vending machine or the coffee machine in the kitchen. In an office it often occurs that colleagues share a machine. But who is responsible for buying new beans, the cleaning or payment? These are tasks that no one likes to take over voluntarily. So what exactly could a fair distribution of those activities look like, and how are they executed most easily? This question calls for an IT supported solution that could be used to track who drinks how many cups and when, in order to balance their accounts appropriately. Furthermore, statistical data can be collected that ensures a fair distribution of the cleaning tasks.

Those aspects motivated us, Cornelius Pohl, Daniel Birnstiel, and Theresa Zobel to develop a solution for coffee machine administration in the office in the context of the tBPM seminar, during the summer term 2015, at the BPT chair of professor Weske. The goal was to create a software that could work largely autonomously and simplify any employee’s work day.
