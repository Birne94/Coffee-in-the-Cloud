# Conclusion

The main goal was to implement a webapplication in order to support the BPT chair at the HPI.

Some core aspects were to have a tallylist and and payment balance aswell as the posibility to provide a convenient way to track the users coffees in the kitchen. This replaces the *old fashioned* tally list that was used before.

Although we could not achieve all the aspects, like payment options or autmatic ordering, we are proud of the project.
During the process of implementation we were supported optimally by our tutors Marcin, Adriatik and Rami. 

All in all one could say it was a fascinating project with a great team. We are looking forward to seing the application in
action!
