# Conclusion


The main goal was to implement a webapplication in order to support the BPT chair.
Important features were to have tallylist and and payment balance aswell as the posibility not only to log in by the useres credentials but also with picture login.
That's because the chair wanted to remove their old-fashioned tally list in the kitchen with a tablet where the coffee drinkers could login by simply clicking on their face and add the coffee.
Although we could not achieve all the aspects, like payment options or autmatic ordering, we are proud of the project.
During the process of implementation we were supported optimally by our Seminar tutors Marcin, Adriatik and Rami. 
All in all one could say it was a  fascinating project with a great team.
