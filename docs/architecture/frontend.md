# Frontend Architecture

The frontend for our Coffee-in-the-Cloud application is written in Javascript using among others the angularJS and requiereJS framework and bootstrap.   

In the following, we will explain our services and afterwards the controllers together with their views

## Services

### alter.js

### coffeeCloud.js

### services.js

### status.js

## Controllers and Views

### Main Page - Home

The  **Main Page** is the first page seen when visiting the coffee-in-the-cloud page. It consists of the  ```welcomeController.js```and the view  ```welcome.html```.

**welcomeController.js**

The main task of the controller is to give an alert-message saying "Thank you for doing the cleaning!". This happens after someone did the cleaning and pressed the *Finished Cleaning* button. In case, something an erorr occured during the function call, another allert will tell you so. 

**welcome.html**

First of all the welcome view has to states depending on whether you are logged in or not.
